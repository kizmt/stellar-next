Newly created diagrams are now editable, full screen mode for more editing real estate, and both apps are updated to the latest version supporting new diagram types (eg. C4 architecture).

Create professional-looking diagrams with line jumps, making it easy to navigate complex diagrams with ease. You can also apply jumps to individual lines or the entire diagram.
